# i3 config

Using i3 a bit more now that I use external monitor setups more regularly (sway sadly doesn't work because my laptop's ports are wired to the Nvidia dGPU).

**Update:** now am able to use sway with `nouveau` with external monitors. So there isn't much reason to use i3 anymore except for if I need the gaming performance of the Nvidia proprietary drivers, and I don't game (on Linux at least).

### Packages:

```
i3-gaps-rounded-git
compton-tryone-git
playerctl
feh
dunst
```
